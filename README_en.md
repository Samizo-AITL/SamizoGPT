# 🧠 SamizoGPT

**A Unified Framework for Prompt Engineering and Project Design Using ChatGPT**

SamizoGPT is an integrated framework that supports structured prompt design, project documentation, and LLM-assisted workflows in technical fields such as semiconductor design, control theory, and intelligent systems.

🇯🇵 [日本語版](./README.md)

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a reusable prompt framework and project structure guide
for developers, educators, and researchers working with ChatGPT-based workflows.

It helps build and operate projects across:
- Semiconductor engineering
- Control systems and AI control
- Educational materials and simulations
